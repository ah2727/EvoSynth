# Evosynth
### Advanced Multi-Agent Jailbreak Attack System

> **🚧 Status: Active Refactoring**
> **📅 Target Release:** Next 1–3 Months

Evosynth is a Jailbreak Attack framework designed to test the safety alignments of next-generation AI models through autonomous multi-agent workflows.

## ⚡ Current Focus: Architecture & Preparation

We are currently refactoring the codebase to ensure scalability and preparing for the release of upcoming SOTA LLMs. Our immediate development goals are:

### 1. Architectural Abstraction (Phase 1)
We are moving away from scripts to a modular, object-oriented architecture:
*   **Abstract Base Classes:** Implementing standardized base classes for Agents, Tools, and Orchestrators.
*   **Robustness:** Centralizing error handling, resource cleanup, and configuration management.

### 2. Next-Gen Model Targeting (Phase 2)
We are targeting new SOTA LLMs using EvoSynth, including:
*   **Gemini 3.0 Pro** 
*   **Grok 4.1** 
*   **GPT-5.1**  
*   Other SOTA LLMs released during code preparation
## 🗓️ Development Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestones |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Refinement** | Month 1-2 | Complete architectural abstraction, error handling, and config systems. |
| **Testing** | Month 2-3 |  Benchmarking against Gemini 3.0, Grok 4.1, GPT-5.1 and other SOTA LLMs. |
